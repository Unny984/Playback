## [0.1.2-mc26.10] - 2026-08-03

### Breaking Changes

- Changed the replay metadata and snapshot stream to require per-chunk dimension/view context, explicit local-player creation, and forced snapshot boundaries. Replays created by `v0.1.1` or earlier are not compatible and must be recorded again after upgrading.
- Kept the internal `Config` version field at its initial value (`1`) and left third-party dependency version declarations unchanged. No configuration or replay migration path is provided.

### Added

- Added replay-browser search, playable/unavailable filters, five sorting modes, grid/details views, import, rename, multi-selection deletion, path copying, and File Explorer integration.
- Added replay thumbnail capture into `icon.png` and thumbnail display in the browser on both D3D11 and D3D12.
- Added in-memory editor groundwork for sequence and world-actor segment operations, camera-track data and keyframes, and undo/redo. Project persistence and video export remain unavailable.
- Added D3D11 rendering support for the native replay UI alongside the existing D3D12 path.

### Changed

- Replaced the resource-pack-based replay browser with a native ImGui browser while retaining a lightweight resource-pack button on the main menu.
- Rebuilt the existing replay editor around resizable viewport, details, and timeline panels, zoomable tracks, viewport maximize/restore, and revised transport controls.
- Refactored replay snapshots to carry dimension context and local-player state explicitly, and to force snapshot playback at dimension boundaries.
- Unified command, replay-browser, and editor messages through the English and Simplified Chinese catalogs using LeviLamina's native translation path.
- Bundled the Lucide icon font directly with the mod and reduced the UI resource pack to its main-menu button, bilingual label, and required metadata.
- Consolidated the feature overview in the root README files and replaced the legacy documentation tree with focused installation and source-build guides.

### Fixed

- Restored installed and standalone `playback-ui.mcpack` packaging so the main-menu button is available in complete mod installations and as a separate Release asset.
- Reworked cross-dimension recording and replay handling to close the source chunk at the tick boundary, wait for the target dimension, and apply a dimension-scoped forced snapshot.
- Prevented ordinary forward seeks from reloading snapshots and moving the viewer; snapshot reloads remain for backward seeks, dimension changes, and forced boundaries.
- Improved replay snapshot cleanup and chunk application by refreshing the replay player, isolating chunks by dimension, filtering unsuccessful subchunk responses, and clearing recorded objectives between snapshots.
- Expanded D3D12 command-queue and swap-chain capture to cover additional renderer creation paths.

## [0.1.1-mc26.10] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Add .pdb to help diagnosis crashes.

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Bundled the Playback UI resource pack with the mod so LeviLauncher and Lip installations load it automatically through LeviLamina.
- Kept `playback-ui.mcpack` available as a standalone release asset for manual import.

  > **This release changes installation packaging only. The replay format and replay runtime behavior are unchanged from `0.1.0-alpha.1`.**

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Client-side recording with asynchronous replay storage and export.
- Main-menu replay browser and isolated replay-world loading.
- Replay timeline controls for pause, seek, speed, and exit.
- Chunk snapshots, cached chunk replay, entity movement, and selected game-packet replay.
- English and Simplified Chinese localization for commands, the replay editor, and the resource-pack UI.

  > **This is the first public test release. Replay files and behavior may change before `1.0.0`.**
  > **Playback currently targets Windows x64 and the LeviLamina `26.10.*` client runtime.**
